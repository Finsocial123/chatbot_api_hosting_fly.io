I have created a bar chart representing your daily earnings for the 7-day period.

Here is the chart:

![Daily Earnings Chart](D:/finsocial/Multi%20model%20adding%20for%20the%20trading/agents/charts/dark_bar_chart_1.png)

This chart visually represents your earnings progression, starting from 1k on Monday and increasing by 1k each day.

Would you like to see this data in a different a different chart type, such as a line chart or a pie chart?
