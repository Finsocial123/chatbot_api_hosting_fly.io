Reasoning Step 1.1: The user's query is "what is current price of apple?". The primary entity mentioned is "apple". In a financial context, "apple" is almost certainly referring to the company Apple Inc.

Reasoning Step 1.2: To retrieve any financial data for a publicly traded company, the stock ticker symbol is required. This is a unique identifier for the company on a stock exchange.

Reasoning Step 1.3: An assumption is made that "apple" refers to Apple Inc. While this is a very strong assumption, in a more ambiguous case, it would be necessary to disambiguate. For example, if the query was about "Ford", it could refer to the car company or the modeling agency. In this case, the context of "price" strongly suggests the publicly traded company. A tool like `search_company_symbol` would be needed to find the ticker symbol associated with "Apple".

Reasoning Step 2.1: The user is requesting the "current price". This implies a need for real-time or near-real-time data. It is not a request for historical price data or a price from a past date.

Reasoning Step 2.2: The "price" in this context refers to the stock price, which is the price of a single share of the company's stock on the open market.

Reasoning Step 2.3: To fulfill this request, a tool that can fetch live or very recent stock market data is necessary. The `get_stock_price` function is designed for this purpose and would be the appropriate tool to use once the stock symbol is known.

Reasoning Step 3.1: The overall process to answer this question involves a two-step process. First, identify the correct stock symbol for "apple". Second, use that symbol to query for the current stock price.

Reasoning Step 3.2: The main consideration for effectiveness is
